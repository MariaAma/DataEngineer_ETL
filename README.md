# Spotify Data ETL (Extract, Transpose, Load) A mini project
This mini project demonstrates a ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project for extracting data from the Spotify API, transposing the data, and loading it into an on-premise database. The primary focus is to illustrate how to interact with the Spotify API, manipulate the extracted data, and store it locally using Python.

# Features
Data Extraction: Fetch playlist data from Spotify using the Spotify Web API and spotipy library.
Data Transposition: Reorganize the extracted data by transposing rows and columns using pandas.
Data Loading: Load the transformed data into an on-premise database using SQLAlchemy.
